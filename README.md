# EHA-Detect-Efficient-and-Hierarchical-Distributed-Architecture-for-Energy-Theft-Detection

Smart grids face major difficulties that cause yearly losses globally of billions of dollars caused by electricity theft. Although traditional machine learning techniques show potential in identifying such theft, they can still fail to address important concerns about the smart grid environment: privacy preservation of client data, and training efficiency on resource-constrained devices. Our experimentation has, in fact, shown that training a model on a client's raw data can take up to 40 times the amount of time needed by our proposed approach. Our work, therefore, introduces a new framework for privacy-preserving energy theft detection combining prototype learning with hierarchical federated learning (HFL). This method guarantees a 94.44\% improvement in training efficiency by training local autoencoders on clients' devices using representative prototypes produced at the client level. These local models are aggregated at the levels of intermediate edges as well as a global cloud server, forming a hierarchical federated learning architecture. While maintaining consumer privacy and lowering communication overhead by 3 times compared to traditional FL methods, the framework is also intended to identify six forms of electricity theft with an accuracy of 82.51\%. Our method seeks to offer smart grid environments an efficient, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for identifying known as well as zero-day attacks.
